## Problem 1

### **Part (c) (2 points) (100 word limit.)**

How does the time complexity of your solution involving matrix multiplication in part (a) compare to your friend's algorithm?

- The time complexity of "my friends" (naive) algorithm is O(n^3). The matrix method, on the other hand, consists of a transpose (O(n) according to [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6131813)) and a matrix multiplication, which can be done in O(n^3) if done by hand. By compounding both notations, we get a time complexity of O(n^3), the same as the naive algorithm. However, time complexity only reflects the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm, so one can be faster by the other in practice. For example, thanks to many optimizations, matrix multiplication can now be computed more efficiently, taking the time complexity to a value closer to [O(n^2.3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10173).

### **Part (d) (3 points) (200 word limit.)**

Bibliographic coupling and cocitation can both be taken as an indicator that papers deal with related material. However, they can in practice give noticeably different results. Why? Which measure is more appropriate as an indicator for similarity between papers?

- The difference is subtle, but I think the main reason why they both end up with drastically different results comes down to the direction in which the relationship between citation and citee is summarized. In cocitation we are summarizing the amount of papers that share a citation in a common paper, or how many papers use the same common source (papers -> source). In bibliographic coupling, we are summarizing the number of papers that cite a common paper or how many sources do a pair of papers share (source -> papers). If we assume that two papers will be more similar if they share a common source, then bibliographic coupling is the better measure, as it will give a higher score to paper pairs that share the most amount of sources. Cocitation on the other hand would be better suited to measure the relevance of a paper, as it will give a higher score to paper pairs that are cited by the highest amount of papers, basically giving a summary on how widespread their contributions have been.

## Problem 2

### **Part (c) (2 points) (100 words, 200 word limit.)**

Observe the plot you made in Part (a) Question 1. The number of nodes increases sharply over the first few phases then levels out. Comment on what you think may be causing this effect. Based on your answer, should you adjust your conclusions in Part (b) Question 5?

- In phase 3, the number of connections surged from 28 to 56, as operations intensified without any seizures. Plotting the evolution of node degrees shows that most players remained loosely coupled with only a few key players, including n1, n3, n12, n83, and n85, experiencing drastic changes in connections as the phases progressed. These findings support the answers found in "Part (b) Question 5", except for node n83. For the rest, the growth pattern aligns with expectations given Daniel Serero's (n1) and Pierre Perlini's (n3) roles as the operation mastermind and former lieutenant, respectively. The new cash influx also probably required an accountant, explaining Wallace Lee's (n85) involvement. Ernesto Morales (n12) served as a main cocaine supplier, which is also a vital role. Alain is the only player not mentioned in Question 5, probably due to him displaying a sudden drop in connections after phase 3, likely due to the first seizure. However, he is the 4th most connected node, so his contribution was still very significant as he probably provided most of the initial funding.

### **Part (d) (5 points) (300 words, 400 word limit.)**

In the context of criminal networks, what would each of these metrics (including degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality) teach you about the importance of an actor's role in the traffic? In your own words, could you explain the limitations of degree centrality? In your opinion, which one would be most relevant to identify who is running the illegal activities of the group? Please justify.

- Degree centrality measures the number of connections that a node has. If a player has a small degree centrality, it will probably mean that they are someone lower in the chain of command (like a dealer), while players with a large degree centrality will probably fulfill more important roles. However, this measure only captures the importance of immediate connections between nodes, so the actual importance of a node could be undermined. For example, if the mastermind of the operation chose to be very secretive and handle everything through a third party, its degree would've been really low, since he would've have only 1 connection, while being the most important player in the operation.

   Then we have betweenness centrality. By definition, betweenness measures the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. In this context, a higher betweenness centrality value could indicate that the node is either a middleman connecting the lower and higher ranks (which would explain why the cocaine importer n12 appeared as one of the nodes with the highest betweenness) or that they are one of the most important figures in the organization, as they are the ones connecting or "glueing together" different sectors of the operation. This would explain why n1 (the mastermind) and n3 (the lieutenant) appeared as two of the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality.

   Finally, we have eigenvector centrality. This type of centrality measures the importance of the nodes that a player is connected to (or are connecting to it). This is why n1 and n3 appeared as two of the players with the highest eigenvector centrality, they are the most important when running the organization as they are basically giving out the orders to everyone down the chain of command. Because of this, I think this would be the best measure to use when identifying key players in the organization. It sorts out actors by their relevance. Once the most important are identified, betweenness centrality could be used to identify the middlemen. By arresting both the most relevant players and their middlemen, the organization should see a significant decrease in its activity.

### **Part (e) (3 points) (100 words, 200 word limit)**

In real life, the police need to effectively use all the information they have gathered, to identify who is responsible for running the illegal activities of the group. Armed with a qualitative understanding of the centrality metrics from Part (d) and the quantitative analysis from part Part (b) Question 5, integrate and interpret the information you have to identify which players were most central (or important) to the operation.

Hint: Note that the definition of a player's â€œimportance" (i.e. how central they are) can vary based on the question you are trying to answer. Begin by defining what makes a player important to the group (in your opinion); use your answers from Part (d) to identify which metric(s) are relevant based on your definition and then, use your quantitative analysis to identify the central and peripheral traffickers. You may also perform a different quantitative analysis, if your definition of importance requires it.

- I believe that the most important players in the trafficking operation are those who provide the most cohesion in the network, bringing together disparate parts to keep the operation going. For example, a key player could be the main drug supplier, as without them, the rest of the operation would halt while the higher ranks search for a replacement.

   With that in mind, I believe that we can use eigenvector centrality to identify the players with the most influence in the network, and then complement the list of suspects with those with the highest betweenness centrality to also identify their most influential middlemen. This leads us to n1 (the mastermind), n3 (his lieutenant), n12 (the cocaine importer), n83 and n87 (the investors), n76 (procurement of marijuana) and n85 (the accountant). The order in which they are captured matters as well: The middleman should be captured first (n85, n76, n83, n87), as they could communicate with the higher ranks in order to warn them, and very soon after, the rest should be captured (n1, n3, n12) to completely dismantle the operation. This will leave the lower ranks unorganized and vulnerable, making it easier to capture them as well.

### **Part (f): Question 2 (3 points) (200 words, 300 word limit)**

The change in the network from Phase X to X+1 coincides with a major event that took place during the actual investigation. Identify the event and explain how the change in centrality rankings and visual patterns, observed in the network plots above, relates to said event.

- The major event that took place in phase 4 was the first seizure. Based on the visual progression of the graph and the evolution in the number of edges and nodes, it seems like after the first seizure, and throughout phase 5, most of the momentum that the operation had going was lost due to a big chunk of the most important players starting to act more cautiously and the non-trafficker members scattering. This can be evidenced by the fact that the nodes that disappeared from phase 3 to 4 were mainly non-trafficker nodes, as well as having the number of edges in the overall graph decrease from 56 to 48 (an 11% reduction), with the highest drop-off coming from Antonio Iannacci (n89), one of the investors.

   He probably saw the clientele starting to fall after the first seizure, and decided to pull most of the funding he provided to the project, not only slowing down operations as the financial resources decreased, but also lowering the interest in other players like Wallace Lee (n85), the operation's accountant. This tendency continued until phase 6, when the operation moved from trafficking marijuana, to trafficking cocaine, causing a slight surge in connections and other centrality measures (like betweenness and eigenvector centrality) in some players.

   Another thing worth mentioning is that Daniel Serero, the mastermind of the operation, saw a gradual decrease in almost all centrality measures as the phases progressed, which could indicate that he was getting more and more cautious as the operation was getting more and more dangerous.

### **Part (g) (4 points) (200 words, 300 word limit.)**

While centrality helps explain the evolution of every player's role individually, we need to explore the global trends and incidents in the story in order to understand the behavior of the criminal enterprise.

Describe the coarse pattern(s) you observe as the network evolves through the phases. Does the network evolution reflect the background story?

Hint: Look at the set of actors involved at each phase, and describe how the composition of the graph is changing. Investigate when important actors seem to change roles by their movement within the hierarchy. Correlate your observations with the information that the police provided in the setup to this homework problem.

- I think the network evolution aligns very well with the background evolution. Here's what I think happened based on the available info: In the beginning, Daniel Serero (n1) and Alain Levy (n83) made the organization grow extremely quickly, jumping at any new opportunity of acquiring new partners, suppliers and investors (supported by a rapid growth in number of nodes and edges). Then came the first seizure at phase 4. This caused many of the non-trafficker members of the organization to lose faith in the project, decreasing the revenue and pushing Antonio Ianacci (n89), another important investor, to pull most of the funding he had provided (denoted by a substantial decrease in his degree). This continued throughout phases 5 and 6, as another big seizure took place during phase 6.

   After this, the chain of command changed. As Daniel Serero grew more careful, he decided to refrain from directly contacting all sections of the organization and made Pierre Perlini (n3) act more and more as his right-hand-man, basically talking through him (denoted by a steady decrease in all measures for Daniel Serero, while a steady increase was seen in all measures for Pierre Perlini). Here they decided add cocaine to their list of products, which caused a slight increase in the number of members of the network (increase in edges and nodes). However, after phase 7, came at least 1 seizure per phase, which caused the organization to slowly lose structure (noted by a rapid decrease in all centrality measures), as the most important players members either started to act more cautiously or slowly disappeared from the network. This continued until phase 11 when the organization was dismantled.

### **Part (h) (2 points) (50 words, 100 word limit.)**

Are there other actors that play an important role but are not on the list of investigation (i.e., actors who are not among the 23 listed above)? List them, and explain why they are important.

The remaining two questions will concern the directed graphs derived from the CAVIAR data.

- n2: One of the 10 highest average eigenvector/Katz centralities, with a relatively high average hub/authority scores. Significantly increased its centrality metrics around phase 8, pointing to tit being an important middleman around that time.

![Figure 4.1](../Images/report-problem-2-part-h-n2.png)

- n41: Higher average betweenness centrality than n89, n6 and n82. After phase 8, its centrality metrics grew to values that rivaled even Serero's, indicating a possible attempt to take over the organization during its final stages.

![Figure 4.2](../Images/report-problem-2-part-h-n41.png)

- n14: Similar centrality evolution as n2, but with lower overall values. Probably a minor investor around phase 8.

### **Part (i) (2 points) (150 words, 250 word limit.)**

What are the advantages of looking at the directed version vs. undirected version of the criminal network?

Hint: If we were to study the directed version of the graph, instead of the undirected, what would you learn from comparing the in-degree and out-degree centralities of each actor? Similarly, what would you learn from the left- and right-eigenvector centralities, respectively?

- The main benefit of including directionality in the connections of a graph, is that we get a better sense of how the information is transferred across the network, while also being able to more effectively infer the hierarchy found within. In an undirected graph, we assume that everyone talks to everybody else in a mutual and level conversation, but in reality, this is often not the case.

   For example, by comparing the in-degree and out-degree centralities of each player, we could identify the "sources" (low in-degree / high out-degree) and "sinks" (high in-degree / low out-degree) of the network. This can be enriched by including relevance information through the eigenvector centrality, as "left centrality" measures the importance of the nodes connected to a player, and "right centrality" measures the importance of nodes that a player is connected to.

   This will make distinguishing between the "middlemen" and the "boss" players in the network, even easier, as "middlemen" will probably have a high out-degree compared to their in-degree, while having a high left eigenvector centrality and a very low right eigenvector centrality, as they receive a lot of information from "bosses", while spreading the news in "low relevance" nodes. "boss" players, on the other hand, will have the same in and out-degree configuration, but with the opposite eigenvector centrality values, as they are the ones that are sending the most information to the "middlemen", while receiving the least amount of information from them.

### **Part (j) (4 points) (300 words, 400 word limit)**

Recall the definition of hubs and authorities. Compute the hub and authority score of each actor, and for each phase. (Remember to load the adjacency data again this time using `create_using = nx.DiGraph()`.)

With networkx you can use the `nx.algorithms.link_analysis.hits` function, set `max_iter=1000000` for best results.

Using this, what relevant observations can you make on how the relationship between n1 and n3 evolves over the phases. Can you make comparisons to your results in Part (g)?

![Figure 4](../Images/report-problem-2-part-j.png)

- From the previous lectures we know that an important "hub" is a node that points to many important authorities, while an authority is a node that is pointed to by many hubs. In the context of the CAVIAR data, we can think of authorities as higher ranking members of the organization in charge of more administrative duties that revolve around handling other people, while hubs consist of "middlemen" that connect different sections of the organization together. With this in mind, we can now look at the evolution of the relationship between the two most important players in the network, "Daniel Serero" (n1) and "Pierre Perlini" (n3).

   Previously in *part (g)*, it was suggested that the basic dynamic between Daniel Serero and his lieutenant was that Serero made the organization grow by expanding the operation himself with the help of investors and suppliers, while Pierre Perlini remained relatively inactive as a means of connection. Then after the first seizure and lowest point in the operation (phases 4 to 6), Serero decided to take things more carefully and gave much more power to Perlini. However, given the hubs and authority scores calculated, it seems like the relationship evolved the other way around.

   According to the score evolution, initially Serero was displaying a more "hub" like behavior, by probably providing his contacts to Perlini and then letting him handle things as the central authority. However, during the phase 4-6 downfall, Serero decided to pull back on Perlini's authority, by taking matters into his own hands (shown by his authority score skyrocketing to almost 8 times its original value) in a desperate struggle to keep the organization afloat. Perlini still remained active throughout this period, with a very similar, but slightly lower authority score than Serero's. This continued until phase 8, when it seems like Serero decided to fully take control of the operation, while Perlini slowly disappeared from the network, probably in fear of the constant seizures that ocurred at each phase (noted by both his authority and hub scores dropping to almost 0).

   Most of the news that covered the arrest of the organization's members, don't mention Perlini's, so its difficult to confirm this theory, but it seems like the relationship between n1 and n3 evolved from one of a "boss" and "representative", to one that shared a more equal power dynamic.
