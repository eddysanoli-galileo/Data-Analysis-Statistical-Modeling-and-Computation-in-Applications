# Data Analysis: Statistical Modelling and Computation in Applications

This repository contains the course work for the MITx course `Data Analysis: Statistical Modelling and Computation in Applications`. The material is separated by module with each one covering a different topic:

- Module 0: Practice, Grading and Other
- Module 1: Review
- Module 2: Genomics and High Dimensional Data

## Usage

Most of the material is written in either Jupyter notebooks (`ipynb`) or R scripts. All the Jupyter notebook dependencies can be installed by running the command `poetry install` after installing poetry in python (`pip install poetry`).

None of the data used to generate the results is included in the repository, both for space and privacy reasons. The data can be downloaded from the course website.
