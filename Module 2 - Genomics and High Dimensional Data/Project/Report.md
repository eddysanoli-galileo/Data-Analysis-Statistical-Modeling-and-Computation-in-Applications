## (Optional Ungraded): Hierarchical Clustering

Recall a dendrogram is the a tree depicting the hierarchy of clustering into increasing numbers of clusters.

Create a dendrogram using the Ward criterion from the projected data. Explain the structure of the data using the dendrogram. Explore the changes in the dendrogram using different linkages. (There is no answer box for this question, and you don't need to include this part in your written response.)

We recommend using R instead of Python for this. See the recitation for an example.
