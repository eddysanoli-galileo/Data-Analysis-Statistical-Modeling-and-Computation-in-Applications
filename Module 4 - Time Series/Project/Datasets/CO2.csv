 formats. Column 5 below gives monthly Mauna Loa CO2 concentrations in micro-mol CO2 per   ,,,,,,,,
" mole (ppm), reported on the 2008A SIO manometric mole fraction scale.  This is the        ",,,,,,,,
 standard version of the data most often sought.  The monthly values have been adjusted    ,,,,,,,,
 to 24:00 hours on the 15th of each month.  Column 6 gives the same data after a seasonal  ,,,,,,,,
 adjustment to remove the quasi-regular seasonal cycle.  The adjustment involves           ,,,,,,,,
 subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor.  Column 7 is a      ,,,,,,,,
 smoothed version of the data generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic ,,,,,,,,
 functions with linear gain.  Column 8 is the same smoothed version with the seasonal      ,,,,,,,,
 cycle removed.  Column 9 is identical to Column 5 except that the missing values from     ,,,,,,,,
 Column 5 have been filled with values from Column 7.  Column 10 is identical to Column 6  ,,,,,,,,
